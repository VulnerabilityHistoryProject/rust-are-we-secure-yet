It originally came from PLOVER, which sometimes defined \"other\" and \"miscellaneous\" categories in order to satisfy exhaustiveness requirements for taxonomies. Within the context of CWE, the use of a more abstract entry is preferred in mapping situations. CWE-75 is a more appropriate mapping.\n"
