CWE-216: DEPRECATED: Containment Errors (Container Errors)
'''
description	= '''
This entry has been deprecated, as it was not effective as a weakness and was structured more like a category. In addition, the name is inappropriate, since the "container" term is widely understood by developers in different ways than originally intended by PLOVER, the original source for this entry.
