title = "CWE-616: Incomplete Identification of Uploaded File Variables (PHP)"
description	= "The PHP application uses an old method for processing uploaded files by referencing the four global variables that are set for each file (e.g. $varname, $varname_size, $varname_name, $varname_type). These variables could be overwritten by attackers, causing the application to process unauthorized files."
